# Dynamic-Weather-Dashboard

A futuristic, neon-themed weather dashboard that brings weather data to life with stunning animations, dynamic backgrounds, and real-time updates. It auto-detects your location and displays current weather with animated backgrounds that change based on real weather conditions.

# 🚀 Features
Auto-detects user’s location (via browser geolocation)

Fetches real-time weather data (using a weather API)

Animated backgrounds / visual themes that adapt to current weather conditions (sunny, cloudy, rainy, etc)

Neon/futuristic UI theme with engaging animations

Responsive layout (works on desktop & mobile)

Clean HTML/CSS/JavaScript implementation

### 🛠️ Technologies
HTML5

CSS3 (custom styles, animations)

JavaScript (ES6+ for API calls, DOM manipulation)

Weather API (you’ll need your own API key)

Geolocation API (browser)

# 🔧 Installation & Setup
Clone the repository:
```
git clone 
https://github.com/Acchu364/Dynamic-Weather-Dashboard.git  
cd Dynamic-Weather-Dashboard
```
Obtain a weather API key (e.g., from OpenWeatherMap or similar service).

In script.js, locate the API-key placeholder and replace with your own key.

Serve the project locally (you can just open index.html in a browser, or use a simple HTTP server).

Allow location access when prompted. The dashboard should load your current weather-condition theme.

```

# Note: Adjust folder names if you have additional assets or sub-folders.

# 🎨 Theme & UI
Neon/futuristic aesthetic: vibrant colours, glow effects, smooth transitions

Weather conditions trigger background/theme changes — e.g., clear sky shows bright neon sun animation, rain shows falling rain effect.

Clean and minimal UI: current temperature, weather description, location name, maybe additional data (humidity, wind, etc).

Mobile friendly: the layout adjusts gracefully for smaller screens.

✅ Usage
Open index.html in your browser.

Allow geolocation access when requested.

The dashboard auto-fetches your local weather and updates the view accordingly.

If you’d like to manually check another city, you can modify the JS to accept a city input (future enhancement).

🔄 Future Enhancements
Here are some ideas for expanding the project:

Add search functionality for arbitrary cities (not just auto-location)

Show hourly and 7-day forecast data

Integrate more weather attributes (e.g., UV index, air quality, sunrise/sunset)

Dark/light mode toggle

More visual themes for different weather events (snow, thunderstorm, fog, etc)

Save favourite locations in local storage

Deployment to GitHub Pages (or other static hosting)
